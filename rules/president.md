# President

## Goal
Get rid of your cards before everyone else.

## Key Terms
- **Round:** Continues until all but one player pass.
- **Pass:** Skip because you can’t or don’t want to play.
- **Lead:** The player who won the last round starts the next.


## Setup
- Deal all cards evenly.
- Determine the first leader: everyone checks their own hand and the player holding the single lowest card (commonly the 3 of clubs or 3 of spades, by house rule) reveals it and leads. If multiple decks create ties, choose the tied player by agreement (e.g., lowest suit order or a quick draw).

## Play
- Card ranks usually run from low to high as 3, 4, 5, …, 10, J, Q, K, A, 2 (2 is highest by common rules).
- Play a single card or a set of equal rank.
- The next player must play the same number of cards of higher rank or pass.
- When all pass, the last player who played leads the next round.

## Example Round
Lead plays a pair of 7s. Next player must play a higher pair (e.g., 8s) or pass.

## End
- First player out is President; last is Scum.
- Many groups trade cards between ranks before the next round.
