# War

## Goal
Win all the cards.

## Key Terms
- **Battle:** Each player flips a card; higher card wins the pile.
- **War:** Tie-breaker where extra cards decide the winner.


## Setup
- Deal all cards evenly; players keep them face down.

## Play
- Both players reveal the top card; higher card takes both to the bottom of their pile.
- Ties trigger **war**: each player places one card face down, then one face up. Higher face up wins all cards.

## Example Battle
You flip a 9 and your opponent flips a 9. You each place one face‑down card, then flip a new card to decide the war.

## End
- A player wins when they collect all cards (or when time is called).
