# Spoons

## Goal
Be first to collect four of a kind and grab a spoon.

## Key Terms
- **Four of a kind:** Needed before grabbing a spoon.
- **Spoon grab:** The moment everyone tries to take a spoon.


## Setup
- Place one fewer spoon than players in the center.
- Deal 4 cards to each player.

## Play
- Everyone passes one card to the left simultaneously.
- Keep passing quickly until you have four of a kind.

## Spoons
- Once you have four of a kind, quietly take a spoon.
- Everyone else grabs; the player without a spoon gets a letter.

## Example Turn
You pass a 9♠ left and receive a 9♥. Now you have four 9s and quietly take a spoon.

## End
- Game ends when a player spells SPOONS (or agreed limit).
