# Spoons

## Goal
Be first to get four of a kind and grab a spoon.


## Setup
- Place one fewer spoon than players in the center.
- Deal 4 cards to each player.

## Turn Order
- All players pass one card face down to the left at the same time.
- Keep passing quickly until you have four of a kind.

## Spoons
- Once you have four of a kind, quietly take a spoon.
- When one spoon is taken, everyone grabs.

## End
- The player without a spoon gets a letter.
- Play until someone spells SPOONS (or agreed limit).
