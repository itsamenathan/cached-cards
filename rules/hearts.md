# Hearts

## Goal
Finish with the lowest score by avoiding hearts and the queen of spades.

## Key Terms
- **Trick:** One card per player; highest card of the led suit wins.
- **Lead:** The first card played to a trick; its suit must be followed.
- **Follow suit:** If you have the led suit, you must play it.
- **Break hearts:** Hearts can only be led after a heart is discarded.


## Setup
- Deal all cards to 4 players (13 each).
- Commonly pass 3 cards (left, right, across, then no pass).
- To find the first leader, everyone checks their own hand; the player holding the 2 of clubs leads the first trick.

## Trick Play
- Players must follow suit if possible.
- Hearts cannot be led until “broken” (a heart is discarded on another suit).

## Scoring
- Each heart = 1 point.
- Queen of spades = 13 points.
- **Shooting the moon:** take all point cards, score 0 and others score 26.

## Example Trick
Clubs are led, so you must play a club if you have one. If you have no clubs, you may discard a heart, which breaks hearts.

## End
- Play to a target score (often 100). Lowest score wins.
