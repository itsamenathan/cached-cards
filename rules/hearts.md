# Hearts

## Goal
Finish with the **lowest** score by avoiding hearts and the queen of spades.

## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck.
- Deal all cards evenly to players.

## Passing (Optional for 4 players)
- Each player selects 3 cards to pass left, right, or across (rotate each round).

## Trick Play
1. The player with the 2 of clubs leads the first trick.
2. Players must follow suit if possible.
3. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick.

## Scoring
- Each heart = 1 point.
- Queen of spades = 13 points.
- **Shooting the moon:** If you take all hearts and the queen of spades, you score 0 and everyone else scores 26.

## End
- Play continues until a player reaches 100 points (or an agreed target).
- Lowest score wins.
