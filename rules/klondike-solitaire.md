# Klondike Solitaire

## Goal
Move all cards to the four foundation piles.

## Key Terms
- **Tableau:** The main working piles.
- **Foundation:** Piles built up by suit from Ace to King.


## Setup
- Deal 7 tableau piles with 1–7 cards; only the top card is face up.
- The rest form the stock.

## Play
- Build tableau piles down in alternating colors.
- Build foundations up by suit from Ace to King.
- Draw from the stock (1 or 3 at a time, by agreement).

## Example Play
You move a red 6 onto a black 7 in the tableau, then reveal the face‑down card underneath.

## End
- You win when all cards are on foundations.
