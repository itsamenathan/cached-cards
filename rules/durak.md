# Durak

## Goal
Avoid being the last player with cards.

## Key Terms
- **Attack/Defend:** One player leads; the defender must beat each card.
- **Trump:** Suit that beats any non-trump card.
- **Beat:** Cover a card with a higher same-suit card or a trump.


## Setup
- Use a 36-card deck (6 through Ace).
- Deal 6 cards to each player and reveal a trump suit.

## Play
- Attacker plays a card; defender must beat it (higher same suit or trump).
- Attacker can add cards of ranks already on the table.
- If defender succeeds, the cards are discarded; if not, defender takes all.
- Players draw back up to 6 cards from the stock.

## Example Turn
Attacker plays 9♣. Defender beats with J♣ or any trump. If they can’t, they pick up all cards.

## End
- Players with no cards drop out; the last remaining player is the durak.
