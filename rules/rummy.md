# Rummy

## Goal
Form melds (sets and runs) and be the first to get rid of all cards in your hand.

## Key Terms
- **Meld:** A valid group of cards laid down together.
- **Set:** Three or four of the same rank.
- **Run:** Three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.
- **Deadwood:** Unmatched cards left in your hand for scoring.


## Setup
- Deal 7 cards each (10 cards each for 2 players).
- Place the remaining cards face down as the stock and turn one card face up to start the discard pile.

## Melds
- **Set:** 3 or 4 cards of the same rank.
- **Run:** 3+ consecutive cards of the same suit.
- Aces are low (A-2-3 is valid; Q-K-A is not).

## Turn Order
1. Draw the top card from the stock **or** the discard pile.
2. Lay down any melds (optional) and add to existing melds (optional).
3. Discard one card to end your turn.

## Going Out
- When all your cards are melded, discard your last card to go out.
- The round ends immediately.

## Scoring (common)
- Face cards: 10 points, Aces: 1 point, Number cards: face value.
- Lowest total score after agreed number of rounds wins.


## Example Turn
You draw the 7♣ from the stock, lay down 7♣-7♦-7♥ as a set, then discard the 2♠.
