# Slapjack

## Goal
Win all the cards by slapping jacks.

## Key Terms
- **Slap:** Quick grab when a jack appears.
- **False slap:** Slapping without a jack; usually a penalty.


## Setup
- Deal all cards evenly, face down.

## Play
- Players take turns playing the top card to a center pile.
- When a jack appears, the first player to slap wins the pile.
- False slaps usually cost a penalty card to the pile (house rule).

## Example Turn
A jack is flipped into the center pile—first player to slap the pile takes all cards in it.

## End
- Player with all the cards wins.
