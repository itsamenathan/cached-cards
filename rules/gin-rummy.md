# Gin Rummy

## Goal
Score points by forming melds and reducing **deadwood** (unmatched cards).

## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck.
- Deal 10 cards to each player.
- Turn one card face up to start the discard pile; the rest form the stock.

## Melds
- **Set:** 3 or 4 cards of the same rank.
- **Run:** 3+ consecutive cards of the same suit.
- A card can only be in one meld.
- Aces are **low only** (A-2-3 is valid; Q-K-A is not).

## Turn Order
1. **Draw** from the stock or discard pile.
2. **Discard** one card to the discard pile.
   - If you took the top discard this turn, you must discard a **different** card.

### First Turn
- The non-dealer chooses to take the face-up card or pass.
- If they pass, the dealer may take it or pass.
- If both pass, the non-dealer draws from the stock.

## Knocking and Gin
- You may **knock** when your deadwood totals 10 points or less.
- Knock by discarding **face down**, then laying out your melds and deadwood.
- If your deadwood is 0, you have **Gin** and earn a bonus.

### Laying Off
- If you **knock** (not gin), your opponent may lay off deadwood onto your melds.
- If you **gin**, your opponent may not lay off.

## Scoring
- Number cards are face value.
- Face cards are 10 points.
- Aces are 1 point.
- If the knocker has less deadwood, they score the **difference**.
- If the knocker ties or loses, the opponent **undercuts** and scores the difference **+ bonus**.
- A gin hand scores a **gin bonus** plus the opponent’s deadwood.

## End
- Play multiple rounds to a target score (commonly 100 points).
- If the stock runs down to two cards and no one knocks, the hand is void and redealt.
