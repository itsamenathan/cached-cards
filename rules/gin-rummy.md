# Gin Rummy

## Goal
Create melds and minimize deadwood (unmatched cards) to score points.

## Key Terms
- **Meld:** A set or run laid down together.
- **Deadwood:** Unmatched cards left in your hand.
- **Knock:** End the round when deadwood is low enough.
- **Gin:** End the round with zero deadwood.


## Setup
- Deal 10 cards to each player.
- Turn one card face up to start the discard pile; the rest form the stock.

## Melds
- **Set:** 3 or 4 of a kind.
- **Run:** 3+ consecutive cards in the same suit.
- Aces are low only.

## Turn Order
1. Draw from stock or take the top discard.
2. Discard one card face up (you cannot discard the card you just took from the pile).

## Knocking & Gin
- You may **knock** when your deadwood totals 10 points or fewer.
- To knock, discard face down, then reveal melds and deadwood.
- **Gin** = 0 deadwood; earns a bonus.

## Scoring (common)
- Face cards 10, Aces 1, Number cards face value.
- Knocker scores the difference; undercut gives the opponent a bonus.


## Example Turn
You draw the 5♣ from the stock, discard the 9♦, and now your deadwood totals 8 so you can knock on your next turn.
