# Canasta

## Goal
Score points by forming melds and canastas (7-card melds).

## Key Terms
- **Meld:** A set of the same rank.
- **Canasta:** A meld of seven or more cards.
- **Wilds:** Jokers and 2s used to complete melds.


## Setup
- Use two decks plus jokers.
- Deal 11 cards each (or 15 each for 2 players).
- Turn one card face up to start the discard pile.

## Melds
- Melds are sets of the same rank (usually at least 3 cards).
- Jokers and 2s are wild, but melds must include natural cards.
- A **canasta** is a meld of 7 or more cards.

## Turn Order
1. Draw from stock **or** take the discard pile (if allowed by your variant).
2. Meld sets (optional).
3. Discard one card.

## Going Out
- Your partnership must have at least one canasta.
- You may go out by melding all cards or melding all but one and discarding.

## Scoring (common)
- Natural canastas score more than mixed.
- Wild cards and red threes are high value; penalties apply for cards left in hand.


## Example Turn
You draw two cards, add them to your 8s meld to reach seven cards (a canasta), then discard the 4♥.
