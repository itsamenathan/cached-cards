# Speed

## Goal
Get rid of all your cards first.

## Key Terms
- **Center piles:** Shared piles you play onto.
- **In sequence:** One rank higher or lower than the top card.
- **Simultaneous play:** Players act at the same time.


## Setup
- Each player has a 15-card stock, a 5-card hand, and two face-down piles for the center.

## Play
- Both players play simultaneously.
- Play a card one rank higher or lower than either center card.
- When stuck, flip a new center card from your stock pile.

## Example Play
The center card is 7. You can play a 6 or 8 from your hand immediately without waiting for the other player.

## End
- First player to empty stock and hand wins.
