# Bridge

## Goal
Partnerships score by making their contract (number of tricks) after bidding.

## Key Terms
- **Contract/Bid:** The number of tricks a partnership commits to take.
- **Trick:** One card per player; highest led suit or trump wins.
- **Dummy:** Declarer’s partner’s hand, laid face up.


## Setup
- Four players in two partnerships; deal 13 cards each.
- The dealer is chosen at random; the player to the dealer’s left makes the opening lead after the bidding.

## Bidding
- Players bid to name a trump suit (or no trump) and the number of tricks.
- The highest bid becomes the contract; the winning bidder is declarer.

## Play
- The player left of declarer leads.
- Declarer’s partner lays their hand face up as **dummy**.
- Must follow suit if possible; highest card in led suit (or trump) wins.

## Scoring
- Points for tricks won in the contract; penalties for failing to make it.


## Example Trick
Diamonds are led. You must follow with a diamond if you have one; otherwise, you may discard or trump if a trump suit was chosen.
