# Baccarat

## Goal
Bet on whether the Player hand or Banker hand will be closer to 9.
“Player” and “Banker” are just hand names; you are not required to play a special role.

## Key Terms
- **Player/Banker:** The two hands being compared (not actual players).
- **Natural:** A two-card total of 8 or 9, ending the hand.
- **Third-card rules:** Fixed rules that decide if a third card is drawn.


## Card Values
- 2–9 face value, 10 and face cards = 0, Ace = 1.
- Only the last digit counts (e.g., 15 counts as 5).

## Deal
- Two cards are dealt to Player and Banker.
- If either totals 8 or 9, it’s a natural and the hand ends.

## Third-Card Rules
- The Player draws on 0–5 and stands on 6–7.
- Banker draws by a fixed table based on its total and the Player’s third card.
- Players do not make hit/stand decisions; the draw rules are automatic.

## Example Hand
Player has 7 and 2 (9) — a natural. The hand ends immediately.

## End
- Higher total wins; ties push most bets.
