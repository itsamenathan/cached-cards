# Crazy Eights

## Goal
Be the first player to get rid of all the cards in your hand.


## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck.
- Deal 5 cards to each player (7 cards if 2 players).
- Place the remaining cards face down as the stock and flip one card to start the discard pile.

## Gameplay
1. Play a card that matches the top discard by **suit** or **rank**.
2. An **eight** is wild and can be played at any time.
3. When you play an eight, announce the suit that continues play.
4. If you cannot play, draw from the stock until you can.

## Winning
- First player to empty their hand wins the round.
- Optional: score remaining cards as points against players.
