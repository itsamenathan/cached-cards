# Crazy Eights

## Goal
Be the first player to get rid of all your cards.

## Key Terms
- **Wild:** An 8 can be played on anything and names the next suit.
- **Discard pile:** The face-up pile you must match by rank or suit.


## Setup
- Deal 5 cards each (7 each for 2 players).
- Place the rest face down as the stock and turn one card face up to start the discard pile.

## Turn Order
1. Play a card that matches the top discard by **suit** or **rank**.
2. An **8** is wild and can be played anytime; the player names the next suit.
3. If you cannot play, draw from the stock until you can (or draw 1, by house rule).

## Example Turn
The top discard is 9♦. You play 9♠ to match the rank. If you play an 8, you name the next suit (e.g., hearts).

## End
- First player to empty their hand wins the round.
- Common scoring: 50 for each 8, 10 for face cards, face value for others.
