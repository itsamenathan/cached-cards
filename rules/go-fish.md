# Go Fish

## Goal
Make the most books (sets of four of a kind).

## Key Terms
- **Book:** Four cards of the same rank.
- **Ask:** Request a rank you already hold.


## Setup
- Deal 5 cards each (7 each for 2 players).
- Place the rest face down as the stock.

## Turn Order
1. Ask a specific player for a rank you already hold.
2. If they have it, they give all those cards; you go again.
3. If not, “Go Fish” and draw one card; if it matches, go again.
4. Lay down any completed books.

## Example Turn
You hold two 6s and ask Alex for 6s. If Alex has them, you take all 6s and go again; otherwise you draw.

## End
- Game ends when the stock is empty or players run out of cards.
- Most books wins.
