# Texas Hold'em

## Goal
Win the pot by making the best five-card hand or by having everyone fold.

## Key Terms
- **Blinds:** Forced bets (small and big) posted before cards are dealt.
- **Bet/Call/Raise:** Put chips in, match a bet, or increase it.
- **Fold:** Give up your hand and any claim to the pot.
- **Community cards:** Shared board cards everyone uses.
- **Pot:** The chips in the middle that the winner takes.
- **Check:** Pass the action without betting when no bet has been made.


## Setup
- Two players post blinds.
- Each player gets two private cards (hole cards).
- Choose a dealer button; it moves clockwise each hand. The player left of the dealer posts the small blind, the next posts the big blind.

## Betting Rounds
1. **Pre-flop** (after hole cards)
2. **Flop** (3 community cards)
3. **Turn** (4th community card)
4. **River** (5th community card)

## Actions
- Check, bet, call, raise, or fold.

## Showdown
- If more than one player remains, the best five-card hand wins (using any combination of hole + community cards).


## Example Hand
You have A♠ K♠. The board is A♥ 7♠ 2♠ 9♦ K♦, giving you two pair (Aces and Kings).
