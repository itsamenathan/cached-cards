# Shithead

## Goal
Avoid being the last player with cards.

## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck.
- Deal each player 3 face-down cards, 3 face-up cards on top of those, and a hand of 3 cards.
- Place the remaining cards face down as the stock.
- Players may swap any number of hand cards with their face-up cards before play begins.

## Card Rank
- From high to low: 2 (special), A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.

## Turn Order
- The first player is the one with a 3 face-up (or the lowest face-up card if no 3s).
- On your turn, play one or more cards of the same rank onto the discard pile.
- Your play must be **equal to or higher** than the top card(s) in the pile.
- If you have fewer than 3 cards in hand and the stock has cards, draw up to 3.
- If you cannot (or choose not to) play, you must pick up the entire pile into your hand.

## Special Cards
- **2:** Wild reset. Can be played on any card; any card can be played on a 2.
- **10:** Clears the pile. Remove the discard pile from play and take another turn.
- **Four of a kind:** If the top of the pile becomes four cards of the same rank, the pile clears and the same player goes again.

## Endgame
- When your hand is empty and the stock is gone, play from your face-up cards.
- Once those are gone, play your face-down cards one at a time, **blind**.
- If a face-down card can’t be played, you must pick up the pile.

## End
- Players drop out when they have no cards left.
- The last player holding cards loses and is the "shithead".
