# Shithead

## Goal
Get rid of all your cards; the last player with cards loses.

## Key Terms
- **Pile:** The face-up play pile in the center.
- **Pick up:** Taking the pile when you can’t play.
- **Clear:** Remove the pile from play with a special card.


## Setup
- Deal 3 face-down, 3 face-up, and 3 in hand to each player.
- Players may swap hand cards with face-up cards before play.

## Play
- Play a card equal to or higher than the top of the pile (same rank allowed).
- If you can’t play, you pick up the pile.
- When your hand is empty, play your face-up cards, then face-down cards.

## Special Cards (common)
- **2:** resets the pile (any card can follow).
- **10:** clears the pile; same player leads again.
- **Four of a kind:** clears the pile.

## Example Turn
Top of pile is 8. You play an 8 or higher; if you can’t, you pick up the pile into your hand.

## End
- First player out wins; last player is the shithead.
