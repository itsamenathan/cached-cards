# Blackjack

## Goal
Have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21.


## Setup
- Deal two cards to each player and two to the dealer (one face up).

## Turn Order
1. Players act in order: **Hit** (take a card) or **Stand** (stop).
2. If you go over 21, you bust.
3. After all players finish, the dealer reveals their hand and draws to 17.

## Card Values
- 2–10 are face value.
- Face cards are 10.
- Aces are 1 or 11.

## End
- Compare each player’s hand to the dealer.
- Blackjack (Ace + 10) usually pays a bonus.
