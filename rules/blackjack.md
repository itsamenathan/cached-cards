# Blackjack

## Goal
Beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without busting.
In blackjack, the **dealer** represents the house; players compare their hand against the dealer, not against each other.

## Key Terms
- **Hit:** Take another card.
- **Stand:** Take no more cards.
- **Double:** Double your bet for exactly one more card.
- **Split:** Separate a pair into two hands.
- **Bust:** Your hand total exceeds 21 and you lose the round.


## Setup
- Each player and the dealer receive two cards; one dealer card is face up.

## Card Values
- 2–10 = face value, face cards = 10, Aces = 1 or 11.

## Player Actions
- **Hit** to take another card.
- **Stand** to hold.
- Optional: **Double** (one more card), **Split** (pairs), **Surrender**.

## Dealer Play
- Dealer hits until 17 or higher (house rules vary on soft 17).

## Example Hand
You have 10 and 6 (16). You hit and receive a 4 (total 20), then stand.

## End
- Busts lose immediately. Otherwise highest total wins.
- A natural blackjack usually beats any 21 and pays a bonus.
- Ties with the dealer are usually a push (no win or loss).
