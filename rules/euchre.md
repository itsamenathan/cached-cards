# Euchre

## Goal
Be the first partnership to reach 10 points by taking tricks.

## Setup
- Use a 24-card deck (9 through Ace in each suit).
- Deal 5 cards to each player.
- Turn the next card face up; its suit is the **upcard**.

## Choosing Trump
1. Players may order up the upcard suit as trump, making the dealer pick it up.
2. If everyone passes, players may choose any other suit as trump.
3. If everyone passes again, redeal.

## Trick Play
- Play 5 tricks per round.
- Must follow suit if possible.
- Right bower (jack of trump) is the highest card; left bower (jack of same color) is second.

## Scoring
- Taking 3-4 tricks: 1 point.
- Taking all 5 tricks: 2 points.
- Failing to take 3 tricks when you chose trump: opponents score 2 points.
