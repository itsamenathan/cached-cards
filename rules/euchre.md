# Euchre

## Goal
Win at least 3 of 5 tricks to score points.

## Key Terms
- **Trump:** The suit that beats all others.
- **Right bower:** Jack of trump (highest card).
- **Left bower:** Jack of the same color as trump (second-highest).
- **Trick:** One card per player; highest trump or led suit wins.


## Setup
- Use a 24-card deck (9 through Ace).
- Deal 5 cards each and turn one card face up.
- The player to the dealer’s left (eldest hand) leads the first trick after trump is chosen.

## Choosing Trump
1. Players may order up the turned suit.
2. If all pass, players may name another suit.

## Trick Play
- Right bower (jack of trump) is highest; left bower is second.
- The left bower counts as trump (its suit is treated as trump, not its printed suit).
- Must follow suit if possible.

## Scoring (common)
- Makers win 3–4 tricks = 1 point; all 5 = 2 points.
- If makers fail, defenders score 2.
- Game to 10 or 11.


## Example Trick
Trump is hearts. The right bower (J♥) beats all; the left bower (J♦) also counts as hearts.
