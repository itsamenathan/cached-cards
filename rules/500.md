# 500

## Goal
Reach 500 points by bidding and winning tricks.

## Key Terms
- **Kitty:** Face-down cards set aside; the winning bidder picks them up.
- **Bid/Contract:** Declares trump and how many tricks you will take.
- **Trump:** The suit that beats all others.


## Setup
- Four players in partnerships.
- Deal 10 cards each; 3 cards go to the kitty.

## Bidding
- Players bid the number of tricks and trump (or no trump).
- Highest bidder takes the kitty, discards 3, and leads.

## Play
- Must follow suit; trump wins.

## Scoring (common)
- Contract made: score its value.
- Contract failed: lose its value; defenders score 10 per trick.


## Example Trick
If clubs are trump and a spade is led, a club will beat any spade if someone can play trump.
