# Nerts

## Goal
Be the first to empty your nerts pile.

## Key Terms
- **Nerts pile:** Your 13-card pile you must clear to win.
- **Foundation:** Shared piles built up by suit from Ace.


## Setup
- Each player uses their own deck.
- Create a 13-card nerts pile (top card face up) and four tableau piles.

## Play
- Everyone plays simultaneously.
- Build shared foundation piles from Ace up by suit.
- Play from your tableau and nerts pile whenever possible.

## Example Play
You move an Ace to start a shared foundation, then place a 2 of the same suit on it while continuing to work your tableau.

## End
- When a player clears their nerts pile, they call “Nerts!” and the round ends.
- Score based on cards in foundations and cards left in nerts pile.
