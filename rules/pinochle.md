# Pinochle

## Goal
Score points from melds and trick-taking; first partnership to target wins.

## Key Terms
- **Meld:** Scoring combinations revealed from your hand.
- **Marriage:** King and Queen of the same suit.
- **Pinochle:** Jack of diamonds + Queen of spades.


## Setup
- Use a 48-card deck (two each of A, 10, K, Q, J, 9).
- Deal 12 cards each; remaining cards form the stock or kitty (by variant).

## Bidding & Trump
- Players bid to choose trump; winning bidder declares trump.
- The winning bidder (or their partner, by variant) leads the first trick.

## Melds
- Score for runs, marriages (K+Q), pinochle (J♦+Q♠), and arounds.

## Trick Play
- Must follow suit if possible; trump wins if played.

## Example Trick
Spades are trump. A trump 9 can win over any non‑trump lead if no higher trump is played.

## End
- Add meld points and trick points to score.
