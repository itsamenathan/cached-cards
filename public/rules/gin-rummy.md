# Gin Rummy

## Goal
Score points by forming melds and reducing **deadwood** (unmatched cards).

## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck.
- Deal 10 cards to each player.
- Turn one card face up to start the discard pile; the rest form the stock.

## Turn Order
1. **Draw** from the stock or discard pile.
2. **Discard** one card.

## Knocking and Gin
- You may **knock** when your deadwood totals 10 points or less.
- If your deadwood is 0, you have **Gin** and earn a bonus.

## Scoring
- Number cards are face value.
- Face cards are 10 points.
- Aces are 1 point.

## End
- Play multiple rounds to a target score (commonly 100 points).
