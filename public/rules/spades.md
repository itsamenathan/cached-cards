# Spades

## Goal
Win tricks to meet or exceed your bid while avoiding overtricks.

## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck.
- Deal all cards evenly to 4 players in two partnerships.

## Bidding
- Each player bids how many tricks they expect to take.
- Team bid is the sum of both partners.

## Trick Play
- Spades are **trump**.
- Players must follow suit if possible.
- Highest card of the led suit wins unless a spade is played; then highest spade wins.

## Scoring
- Teams that meet their bid score 10 points per bid trick.
- Overtricks (“bags”) are 1 point each and can incur penalties over time.
- Failing the bid results in a negative score equal to the bid.

## End
- Play to a target score (commonly 500 points).
