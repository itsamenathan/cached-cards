# Rummy

## Goal
Be the first player to get rid of all cards in your hand by forming **melds** (sets or runs).

## Setup
- Use a standard 52-card deck.
- Deal 7 cards to each player (10 cards each for 2 players).
- Place the remaining cards face down as the **stock** and flip the top card to start the **discard pile**.

## Melds
- **Set:** 3 or 4 cards of the same rank (e.g., 7-7-7).
- **Run:** 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 4-5-6 of hearts).

## Turn Order
1. **Draw** the top card from the stock or discard pile.
2. **Meld** any sets or runs to the table (optional).
3. **Discard** one card to end your turn.

## Going Out
- If you can form melds with all cards in your hand, discard your last card to **go out**.
- The round ends immediately when someone goes out.

## Scoring (Optional)
- Cards left in hand count against you: face cards = 10, aces = 1, number cards = face value.
- Lowest total score after agreed number of rounds wins.
